# Combinatorial Optimization and Decision Making Exam: VLSI problem

This repository contains all the code and the documentation for the project of CDMO. This project was realized for an exam and the goal of it was to solve a combinatorial optimization 
problem using several techniques such as Constraint Programming (CP) SAT solving, SMT solving and Integer Linear Programming (ILP).
