# Combinatorial Optimization and Decision Making Exam: VLSI problem

This repository contains all the code and the documentation for the project of Combinatorial Decidion Making and Optimization at the University of Bologna. This project was realized for an exam and the goal of it was to solve a combinatorial optimization 
problem using several techniques such as Constraint Programming (CP) SAT solving, SMT solving and Integer Linear Programming (ILP).
In all the folders there is the implementation of the solution, the files with the instances of the problem, some additional scripts and the images containing a visualization of the generated solution.
